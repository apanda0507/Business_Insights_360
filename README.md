## 🏢 Company Background

**AtliQ Hardware** is a global seller of computers and accessories. The company operates through three sales channels:

- 🏬 Retailers  
- 🧑‍💼 Direct Sales  
- 🏢 Distributors

Despite its success, AtliQ recently suffered financial losses due to a store launch in America that was based on intuition and non-scalable Excel analysis. In contrast, competitors are making smart moves through robust data analytics. Recognizing this gap, AtliQ is building its own analytics capability—starting with this Power BI initiative.
